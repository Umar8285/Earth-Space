      <h2>Understanding Climate</h2>
      <p>Climate refers to the overall weather of a place that persists over a very long time.  
      Climate tells us about weather to expect over different seasons. Climate is different from day-to-day weather, since day-to-day weather is always fluctuating. Even if today the weather is raining, climate can be dry since very little or no rain will have occurred.</p>
    
      <h2>Angola, Indiana's Climate</h2>
      <p>The climate in Angola, Indiana, is a humid continental climate. This is a climate with hot summers and cold and sometimes snowy winters. In the summer, the weather will typically range between 70°F and 85°F. In the winter, it will drop to 15°F or lower. During the year, Angola receives approximately 37 inches of precipitation and approximately 34 inches of snow.</p>
    
      <h2>Factors Affecting Our Climate</h2>
      <p>There are several reasons that affect our climate. Because we are quite far away from the ocean, we lack the warming influence of the ocean. And we are north of the USA, and that chills the winter. The Great Lakes, and especially Lake Michigan, have much more snow in the winter. This is called lake-effect snow.</p>
    
      <h2>Regional vs. Global Climate</h2>
      <p>The usual weather of a location, like a town or a state, is regional climate. Global climate refers to the overall climate of the world. The earth's overall climate is getting warmer gradually at the current time due to pollution. That is climate change, and climate change can have an effect on the climate of different regions over time.</p>

      <h2>How to Use the Weather Map</h2>
      <h3>What appears on the Weather Map</h3>
      <p>It shows rain, snow, temperature, wind, and storms.</p>

      <h3>Why it Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan Your Day:</strong> On a rainy day, carry an umbrella.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel Safely:</strong> Find out first if there are bad weather conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Safe:</strong> See if storms are coming so that you can stay inside.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Apply It</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the weather map.</li>
        <li>Expect rain, snow, or storms.</li>
        <li>Plan based on the weather (bring an umbrella, dress warmly, etc.).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Open It Daily:</h3>
      <p>Have it available for you to access on a regular basis.</p>
