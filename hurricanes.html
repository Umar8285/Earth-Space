      <h2>How to Track Hurricanes and Stay Safe</h2>
	  

      <p>Hurricanes are giant storms that form over warm ocean waters. They bring heavy rain, strong winds, and even flooding. Scientists track them with direct and indirect measurements.</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct measurements</strong> are sensors on aircraft that fly inside the hurricane to collect wind speed and pressure readings.</li>
        <li><strong>Indirect measurements</strong> are satellites that capture photographs and measure the size and direction of the storm.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>With this knowledge, scientists and places such as the National Hurricane Center can know where a hurricane is headed and how powerful it is. This allows people to prepare and be safe.</p>

      <h2>A Simple School Hurricane Warning System</h2>
      <p>In order to be safe at school when a hurricane is coming, we can have a warning system that works like this:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Watch:</strong> If there is a predicted hurricane hit within 48 hours, warning to the students and teachers is issued.</li>
        <li><strong>Warning:</strong> If there is a hurricane approaching earlier, school officials make sure everyone is ready to move to a shelter location.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Easy School Evacuation Plan</h2>
      <p>How we react if a hurricane is near:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stay Calm</strong> – The teachers and students stay calm and hear warnings.</li>
        <li><strong>Go to the Safe Place</strong> – All go to an in-school safe area, like the gym or interior hallway, away from windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Bring Emergency Supplies</strong> – Take flashlights, water, and snacks to the safe place.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Up to Date</strong> – Keep a radio or phone handy for weather updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Wait for the All-Clear</strong> – Stay in the safe place until it is safe to go home or outside.</li>
      </ul>
