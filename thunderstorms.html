    <h2>Thunderstorms and Flash Floods:</h2>
    <p>A thunderstorm is a severe storm of rain, thunder, and lightning, accompanied by strong winds and/or hail. They happen because warm, moist air rises quickly into the atmosphere and cools. This cooling process leads to the formation of cumulus clouds; however, further developmental conditions of the thunderstorm lead to dense clouds.</p>
    
    <h2>What Happens During a Thunderstorm?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Where air is warm and rises and cools.</li>
        <li>Where clouds form and are strengthened.</li>
        <li>Where rain is precipitated.</li>
        <li>Where lightning occurs because of the electrical charge in the clouds.</li>
        <li>Thunder is simply the sound that lightning makes when it rapidly heats the surrounding air in the atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Flash Floods:</h2>
    <p>Floods happen quickly because thunderstorms sometimes release vast volumes of rain within a short amount of time. Because thunderstorms can develop in smaller areas, flash floods occur, which are rapid floods that happen within minutes to hours of excessive rainfall. Excess rain can overflow streets or even rivers or streams. When the ground cannot process all the precipitation, flooding can happen very quickly.</p>
