       <h1>The Surface Circulation of the Ocean</h1>
    
    <h2>What Causes Surface Currents?</h2>
    <h3>Definition of Surface Currents</h3>
    <p>Surface currents are ocean currents that exist on top of the surface of the ocean. Surface currents exist due to three main factors, which include winds, Earth's rotation, and the configuration of continents. Wind is, however, the most important one. As winds blow across the surface of an ocean, they force water to flow in currents. The winds blow in repeating patterns, including trade winds and westerly winds, which force the water to flow in repeating directions.</p>
    
    <h3>The Coriolis Effect</h3>
    <p>Another force that affects surface currents is Earth's rotation. This is known as the Coriolis Effect. Because Earth is rotating, it pushes moving water to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This is why ocean currents don't flow in linear ways but in huge circular motions known as gyres.</p>
    
    <h3>Continental Influence</h3>
    <p>Land shape is also an influence. Currents, when they flow to continents, have to change course. This is another influence in producing the unique pattern of surface currents on Earth. All such forces play a role in producing these patterns in the oceans now.</p>

    <h2>Impact on Weather and Climate</h2>
    <h3>Currents and Atmospheric Processes</h3>
    <p>Surface ocean currents directly tie in with atmospheric processes like weather and winds. If surface currents change, weather, in addition to other distant places' temperatures, is affected.</p>
    
    <h3>Warm Current Effects</h3>
    <p>If there is a warm current moving towards the coast, it can lead to more rain as well as warmer air.</p>
    
    <h3>Cold Current Effects</h3>
    <p>If there is a nearby cold one, it can deplete the air's temperature as well as dry the area.</p>
    
    <h3>Climate Prediction</h3>
    <p>That is why ocean currents exert such immense impacts on coastal climate. From learning about surface currents, we can more precisely predict weather as well as warn people about climate change.</p>
