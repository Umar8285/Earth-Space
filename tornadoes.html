	<h2> Tornadoes in Our Community </h2>

      <p>A tornado is a fast-spinning column of air that goes from a thunderstorm down to the ground. It can cause a lot of damage in a very short period of time. Tornadoes are so destructive and dangerous because they have very powerful winds, with speeds of more than 100 miles per hour. The winds are strong enough to rip roofs off homes, flip cars over, knock down trees, and level homes.</p>
            
     <p>In Angola, Indiana, tornadoes are a real threat, especially during spring and summer. Some sections of our town and the local area are more open, with fewer trees and buildings to interrupt the wind, and are more vulnerable to damage from tornadoes. Mobile home parks and level stretches of farm fields are vulnerable. While tornadoes are not a common occurrence, we live in a part of the country where they can develop suddenly during severe storms, so we have to be prepared at all times.</p>

	<p class="media-caption">Tornadoes are usually the extreme result of a very large thunderstorm called a supercell. During the storm cold air and warm air combine. The cold air goes drops as the warm air rises. The warm air eventually twists into a spiral and forms a funnel cloud. The sky turns a very dark green color and the tornado begins its destruction.

                <li>Large hail</li>
                <li>Loud, train-like sound during a storm</li>
            </ul>
          		   <p>The National Weather Service issues a <strong>tornado watch</strong> when conditions are right for tornado formation, and a <strong>tornado warning</strong> when a tornado has been spotted.</p>

  <h2> Interactive Activity: Tornado Maker</h2>
  <p> Challenge yoourself to spawn powerful tornadoes with your typing skills. The faster a you can type the "tornado-themed" words that appear, the more powerful the tornado becomes. You have 25 total seconds to type as many words as possible. If you can produce super-massive tornadoes , exceeding 500 mph, your tornado can turn into sharknadoes, pignadoes, frognadoes, and other kinds of tornadoes.

            <p>To stay safe, our town can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build storm shelters</li>
                <li>Practice tornado drills at school</li>
                <li>Prepare emergency kits</li>
                <li>Monitor weather alerts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During a tornado warning, you need to seek shelter in a basement or the lowest level of a building, away from windows.</p>
