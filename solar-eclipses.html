             <h1>Solar Eclipses and Weather</h1>
    
    <h2>What is a Solar Eclipse?</h2>
    <p>A solar eclipse is only possible when the moon goes in front of the Sun. This will make the moon block its light for some time. While eclipses are not very long, they may still change the weather around us in countless ways!</p>

    <h2>How Eclipses Occur</h2>
    <p>Again a solar eclipse takes place when the Moon comes between the Sun and blocks its light from reaching the Earth. It does not last long, but while it does, it creates little but noticeable changes in the weather. One of the biggest is a cooling effect. Since the energy of the Sun is what makes the Earth warm, when it is blocked, the air rapidly cools. In some places, temperatures drop by 10 degrees or more during a total eclipse.</p>

    <h2>Wind Changes During Eclipses</h2>
    <p>The quick cooling of the air during an eclipse can also affect the wind. Normally, the Sun heats the ground, and warm air will rise and cool air will come in. When the Sun is blocked, that warming effect temporarily ends. Therefore, the wind may decrease, turn around, or even stop. When the eclipse is over and the Sun comes out again, the winds resume their normal pattern.</p>

    <h2>Cloud Behavior During Eclipses</h2>
    <p>Clouds can also behave differently. On occasion, there may be invisible thin clouds in the sky earlier that appear to be visible now in the dark sky. Even the sky may appear pale and acquire a twilight look even if it is daytime. It could be a weird but wonderful phenomenon. Certain localities may undergo a small degree of increased humidity as the temperature changes quite sharply.</p>
    
    <h2>Animal Reactions</h2>
    <p>Another interesting effect is how the animals react to the changes. Some animals will think it's nighttime and begin acting differently. Birds may stop singing. Creatures of the night may come out early. Farm animals may head back to the barn. This doesn't change the weather, but it shows how much animals pay attention to sunlight and temperature.</p>
